				<b> On government policies regarding opioid </b> <br> <hr>
				"Although President Trump declared the opioid crisis as a national health crisis, not much has actually been done about it. There are much differences within Congress in itself, for example, the problem with how much restrictions and authority the DEA has when overlooking the distribution of drugs within the USA’s pharmaceutical industry. Lobbyists and interest groups, especially from within the pharmaceutical industry are heavily involved in pushing for laws that will restrict power for the DEA, so that the industry can keep growing, with less limitations in distribution sizes. The way Trump’s administration views the drug addiction crisis is more through the toughening of rules (for instance with the recreational use of marijuana), and regarding the DEA, there are differences in opinions even within the Republican party itself (for example, Marino has opposing viewpoints within the party itself). <br> <br>
			Based on Portugal’s very risky and experimental policies (reference to the readings above), I’d like to propose focusing on health treatments and restorative justice, maybe to go as far for a decriminalization of drugs. The statistics accumulated above shows that economically, the current criminal justice system is very ineffective - being heavily dominated by drug users and not decreasing numbers of addictions at all. Adding to that, its economically draining too. <br> <br>
			The criminal system is expensive. I’m suggesting an allocation of money, so that the taxes people are paying will go to a restorative system, where treatment of drug addictions becomes a health focus. Prisons cost a lot, and when correlated with the problem with drugs, it becomes an endless cycle of repetition as a lot of times when people are released, they struggle with finding legal jobs, resulting back to for example, selling drugs, as the only way of living they’re familiar with (recidivism rates are still over 60%). Besides being ineffective, in the long run, loss of productivity overall, counting in also the costs of handling these addictions when they are at their worst stages, takes more of a toll economically than allowing an open, legal space to receive treatment and receive help to recover..."

				<b> On socializing gender roles </b> <br> <hr>
			 "While television is often a main form to pass time by at a lot of homes, readings books is a heavily used medium, even in today’s culture. In nursery settings, schools, and libraries, hourly sessions are made dedicated just for reading books to children. Children’s books, usually containing illustrations or picture medias of some sorts, ranges from using human characters to animal characters. Janice McCabe et al. investigates the aspect of gender in these books. They revealed that throughout these books, males are evidently more visible through titles and as main characters. And although disparities of character appearances have gotten better, for animal characters, the gap is still big – using pink and stereotypically female ideas to portray a girl animal character, and not a huge number of appearances either. There’s an obvious over representation of stereotype, like the use of pink, ribbons, and frill to illustrate girls or female animals. And on the other side of the spectrum, there’s a lack of appearances of girls as main characters and in titles, which contributes to the under representation. Hand in hand, these over and under representation in the wrong places (stereotypes playing huge roles) adds to the effect on what being a girl means, according to the norms being socialized to young girls. <br> <br>
A well-known example of portrayal which defines femininity in children media is the Disney princess figures, which has existed throughout generations for quite a while now. Since 1973, when the first Disney princess was introduced on television in the form of Snow White & the Seven Drawfs – even today, these characters are still iconic and new movies still being produced. Up to this era, media consumption of Disney princesses beyond movies, in the form of toys, is still occurring. A study done by Sarah Coyne et al. reveals that higher engagement with Disney princesses are associated with higher levels of ‘feminine’ gender-stereotypical behavior in girls. Examples of these include speaking softly, nicely, and being less dominating or smart (although there are some Disney princesses that are definitive of that norm like Mulan as an example of that, but overall the majority is otherwise.) To clarify, this does not mean that the normative idea of what’s viewed as a “girly girl” necessarily means a bad thing. But to put into consideration, on the other side of the spectrum, it also does mean that there is a very narrowed definition of femininity outside of that boxed idea of the usual..."
